Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra, playing a crucial role in various mathematical and scientific fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, and economics. It involves combining two matrices to produce a new matrix that represents the composition of linear transformations encoded by the original matrices. Matrix multiplication is not only essential for solving systems of linear equations but also for understanding transformations, optimization, and data analysis.
